Analyze VPC Flow Logs Data in Athena
Create the Athena Table
Navigate back to the S3 browser tab and then navigate to your Buckets.
Select the provisioned bucket name to open it.
Select the AWSLogs/ folder, and then continue opening the subfolders until you reach the <DAY> folder containing the logs.
In the top right, click Copy S3 URI.
Paste the URI into a text file, as you'll need it shortly.
In a new browser tab, navigate to Athena.
On the right, click Launch query editor.
Select the Settings tab and then click Manage.
In the Location of query result field, paste your copied S3 URI.
Click Save.
Create Partitions and Analyze the Data
Select the query editor's Editor tab.

In the Query 1 editor, paste the following query, replacing {your_log_bucket} and {account_id} with your log bucket and account ID details (you can pull these from the S3 URI path you copied):

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS default.vpc_flow_logs (
  version int,
  account string,
  interfaceid string,
  sourceaddress string,
  destinationaddress string,
  sourceport int,
  destinationport int,
  protocol int,
  numpackets int,
  numbytes bigint,
  starttime int,
  endtime int,
  action string,
  logstatus string
)
PARTITIONED BY (dt string)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ' '
LOCATION 's3://{your_log_bucket}/AWSLogs/{account_id}/vpcflowlogs/us-east-1/'
TBLPROPERTIES ("skip.header.line.count"="1");
Click Run.

You should see a message indicating that the query was successful.

On the right, click the + icon to open a new query editor.

In the editor, paste the following query, replacing YYYY-MM-DD with the current date, and replacing the existing location with your copied S3 URI:

ALTER TABLE default.vpc_flow_logs
    ADD PARTITION (dt='YYYY-MM-DD')
    location 's3://{your_log_bucket}/AWSLogs/{account_id}/vpcflowlogs/us-east-1/YYYY/MM/DD/';
Click Run.

You should see a message indicating that the query was successful.

On the right, click the + icon to open a new query editor.

In the editor, paste the following query:

SELECT day_of_week(from_iso8601_timestamp(dt)) AS
     day,
     dt,
     interfaceid,
     sourceaddress,
     destinationport,
     action,
     protocol
   FROM vpc_flow_logs
   WHERE action = 'REJECT' AND protocol = 6
   order by sourceaddress
   LIMIT 100;
Click Run.

Your partitioned data should display in the query results.
